📚 About Page : 0% (📝 Not started)
- Personal story (focus: journey, values, why you are building).
- 1 photo of you (natural, not corporate).

📩 Contact Page : 0% (📝 Not started)
- Simple contact form (name, email, message).
- OR just link to your LinkedIn DM/Twitter DM.	Optional. But if someone important (investor, co-founder, press) wants to reach you, make it easy.
