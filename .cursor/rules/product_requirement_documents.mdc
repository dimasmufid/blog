📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD) — "Dimas Mufid Blog"

1. Objective
Build a personal blog site to document the journey of building an AI startup — in a way that is authentic, minimalist, and growth-ready.

🎯 Goals:
- Build credibility through real journey sharing.
- Attract global and local audience who resonate with builder mindset.
- Future-proof the site for later personal brand expansion (founder page, speaking, investors, talent attraction).

2. Core Features and Pages
🏠 Home Page
- Short intro about you and your mission.
- Latest blog posts.
- 1 strong Call to Action (CTA): “Follow my journey” → social media links.	Immediately positions you as a builder with a mission, not just another blogger.
🧠 Blog Page	
- List of blog posts in reverse chronological order.
- Title, short preview snippet (3-4 lines).
- Categories/tags optional.	Readers want easy scrolling, not complicated filters at first. You need content-first design.
📚 About Page	
- Personal story (focus: journey, values, why you are building).
- 1 photo of you (natural, not corporate).
- CTA: Follow social media.	Humanize yourself. People follow stories, not "projects."
📩 Contact Page	
- Simple contact form (name, email, message).
- OR just link to your LinkedIn DM/Twitter DM.	Optional. But if someone important (investor, co-founder, press) wants to reach you, make it easy.

3. User Journey (Flow)
Here's how a new visitor should experience your blog:
flowchart TD
  A[Landing on Home Page] --> B[Reads short intro about mission]
  B --> C[Sees latest posts]
  C --> D{Interested?}
  D -->|Yes| E[Clicks to Blog Post]
  D -->|No| F[Explores About Page]
  E --> G[Reads blog post fully]
  G --> H[CTA: Follow on Twitter/LinkedIn]
  F --> H

✅ Simple flow = Higher retention.
✅ Focus on converting visitor → follower, not overwhelming them with complexity.

4. Design Guidelines
- Style: Minimalist, clean, no fancy animation. I am the product, not the website. Content must shine.
- Color Palette: Monochrome. Professional but slightly warm — approachable founder vibe.
- Font: Sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Poppins). Modern, clean reading experience.
- Mobile-first: Must work perfectly on mobile. 60%+ traffic will be mobile. Early audience = mobile readers.
- Speed: No bloated plugins, no heavy images. Fast load = higher engagement, better SEO.

5. Content Structure
Blog must be write in markdown. Which later will by render as dynamic route in the website. Example of initial blob could be :
- Intro Story: "Why I'm Building an AI Startup from Indonesia"
- Build Log #1: "First 30 Days: Wins, Struggles, and Lessons"
- Technical Decision: "Choosing Our AI Tech Stack (and Why)"
- Philosophy Post: "What Inspires Me About AI and Building for the World"
- Book Note: "Key Lessons from 'Show Your Work!' Applied to Founders"

✅ This shows you are serious.
✅ New visitors won't land on an "empty" blog.
