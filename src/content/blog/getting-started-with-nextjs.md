# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building full-stack web applications simple and efficient. In this guide, we'll explore the key features that make Next.js a great choice for your next project.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several benefits out of the box:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improve performance and SEO by rendering pages on the server
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generate static pages at build time for faster loading
- **API Routes**: Create API endpoints within your Next.js application
- **File-System Based Routing**: Intuitive page routing based on your file structure
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Import CSS files directly in your components

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

## Key Concepts

### Pages and Routing

In Next.js, the `pages` directory is special. Each file in this directory becomes a route in your application:

- `pages/index.js` → `/`
- `pages/about.js` → `/about`
- `pages/blog/[slug].js` → `/blog/:slug` (dynamic route)

### Data Fetching

Next.js provides several methods for data fetching:

- `getStaticProps`: Fetch data at build time
- `getServerSideProps`: Fetch data on each request
- `getStaticPaths`: Generate dynamic routes at build time

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful framework that simplifies React development. Its features make it an excellent choice for building modern web applications.
