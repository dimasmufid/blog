# Mark Project

## Background

I am a data professional. I have experienced in building data data pipeline, data modelling, until answer business questions as a report or dashboard. I strongly believe that data is a strong assets for a business. We can easily define whether a business will be growth or gone in the next 5 years by seeing how strong the data is driven the business.

But on the other hand, as my experience in serving business user to optimize their data, there are many cases when the job is repetitive. I have to build the same report or dashboard for the same question over and over again. While the business question and needed is dynamic, current dashboard is static.

Therefore with Mark, I want to help **more business user** to understand their data and answer their business questions **faster** and **better**.

## Solution

With the current development in AI (especially Large Language Model), it is succeed to unlock the opportunity to build AI for helping business user to analyze their data. It is like having a **personal business analyst which is always available by your side**.

But a plain AI is not enough. As my experince in helping business user, the most important thing is **Business Context**. How their business works, their business condition, their business goal, etc. With that in mind, I want to build Mark which could

1. Could give a business context, whether it is a

- csv or excel file,
- company database, or
- external data source (marketplace, ads, etc)

2. Having a strong analyst character. Having critical thinking, could ask the right questions, and objective even when the truth is not what the user want to hear, and a good story teller to help the user understand the data.

3. Help the user easy to understand the data by giving a good visualization, even export the visualization as PDF to help the user present the data to their stakeholder.

## Next Steps

In the next blog, I will show about the **detail requirements** and the **tech stack** that I will use to build Mark.

Stay tuned!
